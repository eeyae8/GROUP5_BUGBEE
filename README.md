# BugBee

**BugBee** is a cutting-edge communication software designed specifically for cave rescue systems. Engineered for integration with the **Nicola 4**, BugBee offers a wider range of communication alternatives when an open speech link fails.

## üö® Key Features

- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Converts spoken input into readable text in real time.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Translates received text back into audible speech using AI-powered synthesis.
- **Compressed Audio and Text Transmission:** Efficient communication using advanced voice codecs and compression techniques.
- **Preset Command Library:** Commonly used phrases are available as pre-set text to speech for speed and efficiency in time critical scenarios.
- **Emergency Command:** Blaring alarm to alert base station of danger! Must be acknowledged to shut off.

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration

BugBee is designed for seamless deployment on the **Nicola 4** system made by the British Cave Rescue Council, offering a wider range of communication options especially in the scenario where an open speech link fails.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Approximation
Due to a short development timespan, the focus was obviously the software. Therefore for the purpose of prioritising rapid development, communication was approximated by high frequency nrf24L01+ RF Transcievers.
This repository code has been optimised for that, using wirekraken's RF24 library. For further information on integration with the Nicola 4 itself, please read the report. 
The screen used is a Nextion Basic HMI Resistive Touch Screen 4.3"
